gene_id, snp_id and p_fdr and should not contain other columns.}

\item{gwas_prefix}{Prefix of the GWAS summarystats file}

\item{gwas_variant_info}{QTL variant information in GWAS coordinates.}

\item{fdr_thresh}{Minimal QTL FDR threshold}

\item{overlap_dist}{Max distance between GWAS and QTL variants.}

\item{gwas_thresh}{Minimal GWAS p-value threshold}
}
\value{
List of data.frames with phenotype_ids and snp_ids to be tested with coloc.
